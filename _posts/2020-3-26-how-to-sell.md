<p class="meta">3.26.20 - San Francisco</p>

Once upon a time, about two years ago, as I embarked on this startup journey, I was a green sprout with nary a sale to my name, completely naive and unencumbered as to what enterprise constituted, what was a funnel, how to lead a discovery call, what it meant to qualify, how to close a deal. Like many technical folks out there who all their lives thought to let the result, the product, the art speak for itself, I had no experience in having to chase down people and ask them to part with money. And while letting the product speak for itself can work to some extent in consumer-facing sales, it's quite another in business-facing deals (aka business-to-business, B2B sales). 

So while there is still much to learn and experience, to try and to rail and to win, let me do my bit to pass on what wisdom I've accumulated these past two years to you, dear reader. 

### Sales

Sales is a whole discipline unto itself. There is actually quite a lot of terminology and practice that goes in it. But if you had to learn one thing, one thing that carries you through many deals, like a small, simple pocket-knife sufficient for opening most things, it is this:

<p class="block">
1. Ask questions
<br>
2. Stop talking and listen
</p>
  
(That might appear to be two things, but it's only so because some people erroneously do one without the other.)

### Ask questions

Ask questions. What kind? you might ask. It doesn't matter. Start with some softball questions. How's their day going? Where are they located? What's the weather like?

Now briefly (briefly!) introduce yourself. Two sentences. Now ask them questions again. 

What problem do they have? How big of a problem is it? How are they dealing with it? How many people does it require? 

What have they tried so far? Why is it such a problem? Did they try X? 

What solutions are they looking at? What's their budget? Who determines their budget? How do they evaluate solutions? 

What's their timeline? 

### Stop talking and listen

Your goal now is to get them to talk as much as possible, to open up to you. The more they open up to you, the more they build trust that you'll listen and hear them, that you might actually be able to fix their problem because you understand. So stop talking and listen.

So many new startup founders talk too much when they're trying to sell something. I know, because I did this. You're trying to explain how you work, how great you'd do to tackle their problem, all the ways you're different. 

I waltzed into my first big enterprise sales meeting at a huge, world-renowned firm, conference table lined with high-level managers and decision makers. I got this meeting because I used to work there and had left to start my business. We already had a small contract with them. I was now pitching them on a organization-wide deal.

I then proceeded to talk, probably about 90% of the time. 

At the end, they shook my hand and said how impressed they were, and asked about my travel plans. I listed other impressive firms we were visiting. Oh wow, they said. They all shook my hand again and waved me goodbye.

Did we get that deal? Did we get any of the other leads on our trip?

I think you know the answer.

I learned to ask questions and zip it.<sup>1</sup>

### Now that you've asked questions, and stopped talking, what next?

It depends. Are they a potential customer? You asked questions for two reasons: 1) to get them to talk and 2) to see if you can solve their problem. Maybe it's the case that you actually aren't a good fit for their problem, now that you've heard it. In that case, tell them so, but ask to keep in touch. If you end up with a solution in the future, you can ping them.

Though, it is likely that you're just starting out. Like a lonely teen looking for a date, most everyone looks attractive. In which case, get a second date! Take the rein, say, "This sounds like it could be a good fit. For next steps, let's [fill in what you'll like to do]." 

Appropriate second date options: running a trial/asking them for data to test with/getting a second meeting with more people/something else.

You'll likely need several meetings before you can land the deal. The bigger the organization, the more meetings, the longer it will take. It can take anywhere from a few weeks to 12+ months. Buckle up for the slow ride.

The likelihood of you landing any one deal is not high, so you'll need to be running several deal processes at once. This is your "funnel". You start out with a large number of prospects. Then you "qualify" them to make sure they're a good fit for your product/ service/solution. 

From the remaining, you'll move to next steps. 

To illustrate, here's an example with a strapping teen, Mustafah, selling something we can all relate to - himself.

### Mustafah's funnel

Mustafah, 17, is looking for a girlfriend. He's learned how to drive, so he can offer rides, his lanky frame, and weekend video game sessions.

<p class="block">
Prospects - 50 girls in a 15-mile radius. → Mustafah's move: Text them all <br>

First cut - 20 girls willing to date a teenager. → Mustafah's move: Ask them for a call <br>

Second cut - 10 girls actually willing to talk. → Mustafah's move: Call them <br>

Third cut - 5 girls who actually pick up the phone. → Mustafah's move: Talk to them <br>

Fourth cut - 3 girls willing to go on a date.<sup>2</sup> → Mustafah's move: Arrange dates<br>

Fifth cut - 2 girls who liked their date enough to go on a second one. → Mustafah's move: Arrange second date <br>

Sixth cut - 1 girl who likes their second date enough to go on a third one. → Mustafah's move: Arrange a third date, and make it so good she wants to go steady. <br>
</p>

But what if the lone remaining girl doesn't like her third date enough to go steady? you might ask. Well, that's a risk. To mitigate this risk, Mustafah might consider broadening his funnel. Maybe he looks for ladies in a 30-mile radius, so he increases his top-of-funnel numbers. Though, he wouldn't want to go too far, otherwise he'll be stretched too thin and also be perceived as spamming the girls.

Sometimes you'll get lucky, and you land the first lead you talk to. Other times, you might have to talk to dozens before you land a deal. In any case, if you want to land multiple deals on an ongoing basis, you'll have to implement a funnel to ensure your chances.

I hope this is illustrative for you, and helps you make sales of your own!

<sup>1</sup> There are a few times when you get to go on a spiel. That's 1) when the prospect asks you questions and 2) after you've let them talk a lot. And even then, don't talk more than necessary.

<sup>2</sup> One girl says she'll only date guys who know how to crochet. Mustafah doesn't know how to crochet. Should he learn how to crochet? Depends on 1) How hard/long it'll take him and 2) How many other options he has (who don't require crocheting skills). In this case, Mustafah doesn't have a lot of options, and despite having two left thumbs he negotiates to learn crocheting if it turns into a real relationship.

Leads will often request special things from you. Push back a little, see how much they need it. And if they insist, and it's something you can do, say you'll do it if you have a deal. That way you make sure they're willing to make a trade, and not just running you around in circles.
