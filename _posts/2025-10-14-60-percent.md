Life is an iterative process. You won't have infinite chances at bat, but you will likely have at least a few. 

I've noticed that some people handicap the general gist of their aims by seeking perfection at each step. They over-optimize when simply optimization is necessary, and for the penny lose the pound. 

But one may ask, how to decide what is good enough? Surely one cannot accept simply anything available. 

The number I've used in my personal life is roughly 60-65%. **If something is at least 60-65% of what I seek, barring non-negotiables, it's good enough.**

I'll now explain the background behind this number, and how it plays out over time.

*In order to reach the next floor, you usually take several steps upstairs, not just one.*

### Schelling's Model of Segregation 

Over a decade ago, when I was 23 years old, freshly graduated from my Master's, I stumbled upon Schelling's Model of Segregation in an online course (these were the early days of Coursera). It was so interesting and enlightening, I immediately recognized two things: 1) the usual prescribed undergraduate university education was severely lacking, and 2) this would have implications for one's life and decision making in general.

Schelling's Model of Segregation concerns how cities come to be so segregated over time. In the early 1970's, the economist Thomas Schelling remarked that while the United States had come far in its racial acceptance, its cities remained stubbornly segregated across the board. This remains true in many places today.

Schelling showed that cities can become highly segregated with even a slight preference for living next to one's racial group. Say, perhaps you don't mind living next to 30% of people who look different from you. Maybe even 50, 60%. But perhaps, if it was 70%, you would move. (Side note, this clearly did not apply to my family. I grew up as the only East Asian family for about a 50 mile radius in Texas country.)

Over time, even a small preference for living next to others of a similar ethnicity leads to a very segregated city over time. 

But even final segregation was a marker of some tolerance: at high (75%+) intolerance, the 'board' would never settle -- people would just keep moving. 

### How This Applies to Career

My main takeaway from this, as a young adult freshly unleashed on the world, was that reaching my goals was an iterative process. Even if I did just some things right, but not all, over time I would get closer to my goals.

Thus, when looking at jobs to apply for, I did not seek perfection. I simply sought something that met ~60% of my aims.

This also applied to startup ideas, when I eventually started my own company at age 27. Artificial intelligence (AI) was still nebulous back then -- a lot of tech was there and being used by the tech giants, but how it applied outside tech was still an open question. But it was a growing, exciting field, and that was good enough for me. So I started an AI company, and entered the YCombinator Winter 2018 batch soon after.

But you might still be asking, why ~60%? Why not something lower, [like 37%](https://rosaxote.github.io/main/2026/02/27/optimal-stopping.html)?
