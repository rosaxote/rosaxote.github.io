*Crystal ball, the future is in your gaze, coalesce your vision for me in that effervescent glaze. What thoughts hide behind that dome? What more do your gentle threads bode? Come bring me the future if all humankind worked from home.*

Now, I don't expect all humankind to work from home, but what might happen if a significant chunk of knowledge workers did so? I've done so the last two years while running a startup, so I have some first-hand experience. Here are my thoughts:

### List of 10 possibilities

1. **Home matters much more.** Your roommates matter more, you need more space, you need a home workstation(s). Some people may shift back to the 'burbs and/or live closer to family.

   1a. Businesses close by residential areas will see more demand, which may spur businesses to go there. But, that will be capped by a rise in cloud models (delivery-first businesses). The main bottleneck to cloud services will be delivery (tech enabling faster, cheaper, automated delivery will help). 	

   1b. There will be a shift to houses vs. apartments. At least, at first before apartments figure out their location is less of/no longer a selling feature. Then, apartments will evolve by offering more amenities (normal apartments will need to start looking like luxury apts).

2. **Salaries will level out.** When companies can choose from anyone, provided they have language and cultural fit, they will offer fewer Bay area salaries and bump the pay of cheaper locales. This will also drive bigger profits for companies.

3. **Everyone will need more cleaning services.** People can't spend their workday running the dishwasher and cleaning up after cooking. Companies will need to provide perks for this if people are going to work remote long-term.

4. **Diffusion.** As Bay area tech companies are the first to go remote, techies will spread out to other cities (Denver, Austin, Hawaii). Not everyone will go, but there will be some diffusion. This will cause Bay area real estate/rental prices to go down. But, people will realize that they like living next to similar people - e.g. startups will want to move to a city other startups are at too. So, it will raise demand for certain other locales. The main points will be time zone, standard of living to price, where other techies are.

5. **Business travel will go down** (many ppl have said this). We started out our company traveling to different cities visiting prospective customers. It is nice to meet people in person, but we didn't land any of our customers this way. We landed our first customers after we realized it wasn't necessary to meet people in person, video calls work too - and was a lot cheaper. Will personal travel go up? I don't know. Maybe being a digital nomad - living and working from different places - will go up instead.

6. **People will go out less.** This happens if you live with your friends, and you spend your socializing at home. Related to #1, home amenities will be more important. Maybe people like pools, saunas at home. Extra living spaces will be helpful. 

   Perhaps people will go out more at first, to get their socializing in while living in their current space. But as leases come up, more people will ask why not live with a group of friends. Or, move as a group into an apartment building (or to a block of houses) so you get private space and friends nearby. People already did this before, but more people will seek it when work doesn't serve their social needs as much.

7. **Tech companies realize that people need some in-person time.** Completely remote works well for tech-heavy companies - programmers work well alone. But creative and team efforts will be hampered by being remote. 

8. **People will shift ways to meet new people in person.** Work and school have been major ways people meet each other. Where people live will become how people meet each other.  

9. **Downtown will get emptied.** Perhaps it will be transformed into living space. But, without the draw of work, there will be no reason for people to live near office buildings. People will move to spaces with more space, more green, more local businesses, more outdoor recreation.

10. **Cities will have to be more competitive** to retain residents. They can't let crime, filth fester because people can move away now. They aren't tied to a locale by work/in-person meetings. Companies have more choice where to locate smaller HQs (and where to pay taxes).



### Being in-person drove density

In essence, being in-person drove density. People needed to be (reasonably) close to their work, which also drove restaurants, shopping, entertainment to be close to all that. If people don't need to be close to their work, restaurants, shopping, entertainment will shift to where they live. People still like being around others, but there will be more diffusion as people no longer have to be crammed in close quarters. 

**Furthermore, the rise of on-demand delivery will mean even more diffusion.** Now people don't even need to be near lots of shopping, groceries, etc. The main bottleneck will be on-demand delivery methods. Automated drones/vehicles would help this a lot, if they can get over politics. Maybe the tech will move to locales that allow this, and people will follow.

That said, people like public spaces. They like strolling through a vibrant community center with restaurants, arts, and entertainment. But people gravitate to the lowest energy orbit. Maybe this means more mobile restaurants and entertainment.


### Bonus predictions from the crystal ball


1. **More free time, more hobbies.**  People now have 1-2 more free hours in the day without commutes. They'll want to find things to do with that time, with reading, hobbies, socializing, exercising, games.

2. **People will be farther, but also more inescapable.** This will extend what happened when people got cell phones, then social media. More people remote means less social barriers to asking to hang out. Now there's less excuse to turn down a video call, when you're not even being asked to dress up and go out! People will need a "silent mode" for their time.

3. **Social circles might shrink for some and widen for others.** This depends on how much home/leisure replaces work for meeting new people. If you have a good home/leisure engine for meeting new people, you will both meet more people and get to know them better/faster. If you don't, you will spend more time with people you already know.

4. **Companies will have issues with culture.** Establishing a remote culture is harder than in person. People will have less loyalty. On the flip side, there will be less politics.



### Services for a work-from-home population

Here are some ideas for services/products geared for a work-from-home crowd:

- More casual wear - jeans, tennis shoes, sandals, athleisure. Less formal wear. Less makeup.
- More games.
- More reading/newsletters/blogs/books/essays. Tools to help consume and produce.
- Social living places. Groups that organize social events for a building/block/other community. Residences that provide living space, activities, and work setups.
- More outdoor equipment, products, services.
- More crafts, hobbies. 
- More cooking services/products.
- Brokers helping US tech firms find top talent in other countries.
- Custom video call backgrounds.
- AR for video calls (Why share your screen when you can write/draw/share directly on the video?)
