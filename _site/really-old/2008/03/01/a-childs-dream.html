<h1 id="a-childs-dream">A Child’s Dream</h1>

<p class="meta">March 2008 - College Station, TX</p>

<p>Once upon a time I was a child that dreamed about rainbow-colored lollipops the size of my face, lollipops that lasted forever; once upon a time I was a child that dreamed about cardboard boxes filled to the brim with stuffed toys, toys that promised play to my heart’s endless satisfaction.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I was a girl that dreamed about kissing the guy she had a crush on; once upon a time I was a girl that read about number theory and dreamed of discovering, independently, the proof to Fermat’s last theorem.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I was a teen that watched her family’s motel gain business and thrive; once upon a time I was a teen that watched the motel burn down while the fire trucks took an hour and a half to arrive in a town with a two-mile radius; once upon a time, in a moment of infinite courage, I was ready to lose everything as long as I had my family.</p>

<p>And in those months after that terrifying time, I was a teen that experienced something she can only describe as a death on earth, absolute peace, heaven.  And sometime during that time I became a young woman.</p>

<p>It amazes me now, several years and experiences later, that so many people, adults, still walk around dreaming about something akin to the everlasting lollipop, the toys of endless joy.  What is this something?  The heaven ubiquitous in religion.</p>

<p>I attended Catholic school as a small child, so I grew up believing that men were made from clay and Eve somehow came from Adam’s rib and that Jesus loved you and could save you from your sins if you only believed in him.  I had some questions, though, like: If men were made from clay, and if Adam was the first man, so that everybody else was born from him and Eve, then was Adam the only man made from clay?  Or was everybody made from clay and stuck in a womb?  And I also couldn’t figure out why everybody made such a big deal of “Oh, Jesus died for you, he loved you so much,” I mean, I thought, Who wouldn’t die for their beliefs if they truly believed in them?  There are many people who have done that and they’re not worshiped, just admired.  But I considered these questions close to blasphemous and dared not follow them to their ends, which would likely reveal things that would upset the ideas put into my head by the Sisters that taught me.  But it would not be long before those ideas were upset by the very people that believed in them so fervently.</p>

<p>It happened when I started attending church in America.  I had moved from Taiwan when I was five and we didn’t attend church for some years.  Then, when I was around the age of ten, suddenly church-going was the thing to do amongst my age peers and I went along with them.</p>

<p>I remember church.  There the preacher was, way far up ahead past the rows of well-dressed men, women, and children, raising his hands toward the tall ceiling overhead where bright lights illuminated the chapel below, declaring:</p>

<p>“And let me tell you, o children of the Lord, He will reward those that are faithful to Him; He will bring them into the Kingdom of Heaven.  In the Kingdom of Heaven sweet nectar flows in rivers, there is music unlike any heard on Earth, there is only happiness and peace, for then you are under His wing, you are in His home, you are His beloved.  And for all eternity!”</p>

<p>He talked also of hell:</p>

<p>“There is a stench in Hell so terrible you will want to die again, just to be rid of it!  Great fires consume your body at every moment, you are in agony!  Other sinners howl and paw at your body; they are in such misery, as you are!  Constant torment!  Can you imagine it!”</p>

<p>It struck me at those times how earthly those descriptions were, so visceral, so obviously concocted by men.  So who died and came back and told this preacher all this?  And then I would see the men and women get up in front of me when it was time to sing; some of them would raise their hands upwards and shut their eyes fiercely, singing with all the feeling in their soul, and I would think: Wow, how earnestly they believe!</p>

<p>I think now: Can they truly believe that unconditionally?  Can they believe that a person will either go to heaven, where there is endless happiness and good, or to hell, where there is endless misery and evil - so starkly white and black?  Even though God loves all his children?</p>

<p>I wonder that, because my heaven came after my darkest point in life, could’ve only come with such a dark point.  The greatest heights can only exist from the greatest lows; a mountain can be no taller than the depths of the valleys it arises from.  How can somebody know heaven without knowing hell?  And further, my heaven did not consist of endless happiness.  It consisted of absolute peace.  In fact there was no emotion in it.</p>

<p>Heaven is to be found nowhere but here in life, here where I was given mine, here where we walk and talk and laugh and play, where we cry and argue and sigh and dream.  Real heaven is not endless happiness; it is something much more intricate and colorful and meaningful, and can meet you at different times in your life in different ways and forms.  Many people are naïve in what they imagine as heaven and mistaken as to how to get it and where to find it.  To expect heaven to be a place of perpetual joy, attained after a lifetime of goodness and faith, is like expecting a gigantic lollipop that doesn’t shrink no matter how long you lick it, after obeying your mother.</p>

<p>It’s a child’s dream.</p>
